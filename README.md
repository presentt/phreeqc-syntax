# Syntax highlighting and language features for PHREEQC

This extension brings syntax highlighting to PHREEQC in VSCode.
It borrows heavily from the syntax highlighting features from the original Notepad++ version.

[Notepad++ distribution](https://www.hydrochemistry.eu/)



## Usage

After installation, open a `.phr` file and edit it as you would any scripting language. syntax highlighting will appear and basic language functionality will be available (eg. commenting and indentation).

This package does not include a Phreeqc installation. If you need to install PHREEQC,you will have to do it yourself. Both distributions should work:

- [Appelo's webiste](https://www.hydrochemistry.eu/)
- [USGS](https://www.usgs.gov/software/phreeqc-version-3)
